1. Why does the car battery die often?
 



 

A damaged or dead car battery is among the most frequent and common car problems that can occur at any moment. The battery provides power for all functions in your vehicle, including starting the engine and operating the lights or air conditioning. If it’s weak or not serviced, your car might not start or could suddenly die while driving. 

 

But, the reasons it happened depend on a lot of factors, which include - 

 

1. Not driving regularly - If the car isn’t used for a few days or only taken on short trips, the battery doesn’t get enough time to recharge through the alternator. Which slowly drains and damages it. 


2. AC or Lights Left On - Forgetting to switch off the headlights, cabin light, or AC after parking can easily drain the battery overnight.


3. Old or Damaged Battery - Car batteries usually last around 3-5 years. If yours is older or damaged, it may not hold a charge well and die more often.


4. Unusual Weather Conditions - All sudden changes, very hot or cold temperatures, affect battery performance and can shorten its life.

 
How to solve it?
 

1. Firstly, make a rule to always check and switch off all the parts, including lights, AC, and music system, when you turn off your car. This helps your battery last longer and reduces all extra car repair costs.


2. If your car doesn’t start, try using jumper cables to start it or call someone from roadside assistance to help you sort it out. 


3. Get your car battery timely replaced every 3 to 5 years, depending on your Car Battery Lifespan.

 

Note: As per the 2025 latest statistics reports, the average cost of a new car battery in India on an average is ₹3,000–₹6,500, further depending on the car model and battery type.

 

2. Why is the engine overheating?
 



 

Overheating car issues of the engine are a serious issue and should never be marked ignored. This can occur at any moment if not checked on time and can cause your car some permanent damage to the engine. For example, say, it can happen unexpectedly while driving and can lead to permanent engine damage if not stopped in time. 

 

Moreover, the engine operates at extremely high temperatures and depends on the cooling system to regulate this heat. This essentially means that if any component of that system fails, the engine will begin to overheat. These common vehicle issues are particularly common in summer, on hilly drives, or in city traffic jams.

 

It usually means the engine is not cooling properly. Mostly, the reasons behind this are:

 

1. Low coolant or a leaking radiator


2. Faulty thermostat


3. Damaged cooling fan

 
How to solve it?
 

1. Turn off the AC immediately to avoid any future car AC issues and pull over your car.


2. Check if coolant levels are low (never open the radiator when hot!)


3. If you are unsure, get a mechanic or visit the nearest MyRaasta service centre and get your engine checked.

 
3. Why does the Car pull to one side while driving?
 



 

If your car suddenly starts moving left or right without turning the steering wheel, there’s likely a problem with the wheel’s alignment. This happens when you hit a pothole or speed bump too hard. Another reason for this can also be Uneven tyre pressure or worn-out suspension parts. But what are the reasons behind it, due to which it is caused? 

 

1. Wheels Misalignment - This is one of the most common car problems and the majority time reason for your car pulling to one side. This happens when the angles of the wheels do not match and are set incorrectly. 


2. Uneven Tyre Pressure - If the air in the tyres isn’t similar or lower than the others, this can change the direction of the car and divert it towards the wheel with lower pressure. 


3. Worn Out Suspension - A perfect suspension system keeps your car running smoothly and stably. But if any part of it, like the shock absorber or control arm, is damaged, the entire control and alignment of the vehicle are affected. Which can even cause the car to bounce or brake failure. 

 

And like these, there are many other parts which, if they go wrong, can change your driving direction without you doing anything, and cause major damage. But we even have solutions for all these situations, that you can follow to avoid any accidents. 

 

How to solve it?
 

1. Get a wheel alignment and balancing done.


2. Check tyre pressure—uneven pressure can also cause this damage.


3. Inspect your tyres carefully for inconsistent wear or damage.

But getting regular Car maintenance, like alignment, wheels check, and more, helps avoid this problem and also improves fuel efficiency.

 

4. Why is the AC not cooling properly?
 

Summers and rainy seasons make the weather hot and humid. But in these conditions, your ‘AC not cooling’ is one of the easily troubling common car problems in India. Isn’t it?  But did you find the reason behind it? As this can just be the beginning, which rapidly grows in the summer and monsoon season. But what's causing it is the loophole we’ll let you know! 

 

Reasons Causing Car AC Issues:
 

1. Low refrigerant gas 


2. Blocked air filter


3. Electrical issue in the compressor


 

How to fix it?
 

1. Clean or change the cabin filters

2. Recharge the AC gas if it's low.

3. If the problem continues, use MyRaasta’s Car AC Issues service for a full AC inspection and repair.

5. Why Does My Car Give Weird Sounds?
 

Are you recently noticing weird-strange noises from your car? There aren’t any noises, but there can be signs of trouble happening in your car. But what are all these sounds or what are pointing towards?

 

What Do Our Car Sounds Mean? 
 

1. Creaky noise: This high, sharp sound usually happens when your brake pads are worn out. As the pads get too thin, which leads to a small metal part touches the brake disc (rotor) and creating a creaky noise. These are small warnings that warn you that the brake pad needs to be replaced soon. 


2. Clicking: A continuous clicking or popping sound, during the time you are turning, can mean that your car has a problem with CV (constant velocity) joints. CV joints help your wheels turn without difficulty while enabling power to transfer to them. If these wear out or the boot runs a tear, dirt can enter and cause havoc.


3. Grinding: If a grinding-like sound is coming from your vehicle while changing gears means there is some trouble happening within the gearbox or clutch mechanism. With this kind of noise coming, it is very much possible that the clutch isn’t disengaging properly or that the transmission may be compromised.

4. Knocking: If you hear a knocking or high-pitched metallic-like sound from your engine, there is a high chance that your car's fuel isn’t burning properly at the moment. This can be caused due to bad spark plugs, poor-quality fuel, or wrong engine timing.

 
What Should You Do?
 

1. Take note of when and how the noise occurs. Is it only occurring during braking, when turning, or only during acceleration?


2. Take your vehicle to a mechanic or workshop you trust and get your vehicle fully checked.


3. Or, try reliable services like MyRaasta to book a full vehicle inspection at your doorstep, saving you time and hassle.


4. Timely detection helps in reducing repair costs while enhancing your car’s safety enhanced for the roads.

 
6. Why is the “Check Engine” light on?
 

The Check Engine Light is a warning on your dashboard that something is wrong with the engine or nearby parts.

 
Possible causes:
 

1. Loose fuel cap


2. Sensor failure


3. Low engine oil


4. Exhaust system issue


 
What to do?
 

1. First, check the fuel cap.


2. Then check the Car Engine Oil and top it up if low.


3. If the light stays on, get the engine scanned with an OBD scanner.


 

Failing to address this issue can lead to increased car repair costs later.

 
7. Why does the car take time to start?
 

Slow starting is often due to battery, starter motor, or spark plug issues.

 
What you can do:
 

1. Check the battery first


2. Turn off the radio/AC and try again.


3. If it continues, get the starter and plugs checked by a mechanic.

 

These are mainly used car problems or found in old vintage models. Which is why it’s important to make sure their service is done without any delays. 

 

 8. Why Are The Brakes Soft or Noisy?
 

Did you know your car brakes are the most important safety parts of your car? Yes, brakes are the most critical features of the car’s body! Which is why it’s always important to remember that if they are feeling soft, making noise, or not stopping, it’s time to get them replaced or repaired as soon as possible. If this is not done on time, then your vehicle can get into some serious high-budget problems as well. Besides, ignoring brake problems not only puts your safety at risk but also makes car repair costs higher later.

 

Common signs of bad brakes are:
 

1. Squeaking or grinding noise. Usually, it is a sign that your brake pads are definitely worn out and thus they create a rubbing friction with the disc. This can cause damage to the rotor if you do not replace it on time.

2. The brake pedal feels soft or spongy. A soft pedal means, firstly, there may be some air in the brake lines, and secondly, there may be a low level of brake fluid that therefore makes it difficult to stop the car at a time without brakes. The car takes longer to stop. If your car is not stopping as quickly as it used to be, then it is definitely time to have your brakes checked.

 

How to Fix it? - 
 

1. Changing brake pads every 20,000 to 30,000 km. In case you are a safe driver, your pads will not wear out that much, but don’t worry, even if they do, they still can be replaced to keep the stopping power.


2. Regularly inspect the brake fluid and top it up if it is running low. Be aware that if the level of the fluid decreases, your brakes may feel spongy and will not function correctly. 


3. Review brake discs and callipers. If there are brake discs and callipers, the source of the sound and dysfunction must be identified and fixed.


4. For later, book the full brake inspection with MyRaasta at your convenient place, through which you can always be safe and avoid expensive fixes.

 
9. What Are the Common Issues During Monsoon?
 

Monsoon season never comes alone but with its own set of monsoon car problems. Monsoon car problems affect your vehicle in such a way that it performs and is safe to drive. Water on roads, waterlogging, and high moisture, if not checked on time, can become the reasons for the parts getting burnt.

 

Essential Parts to check during monsoon:
 

1. Wipers
If your wipers leave scratches or continuously pause and do not clean properly means they need to be replaced instantly.


2. Headlights and taillights
If your lights look dim or foggy, it becomes hard for you to see the road and for others to see your car. Clean them or get bulbs replaced before any problem hits you.

3. Tyres
Make sure your tyres have a strong grip and are not smooth or bald. Bad tyres can make your car slip or skid on wet roads, especially during rain.


4. Battery and electricals
Rainwater or moisture can enter your car’s wires and electric parts very easily, which can stop your car from starting or cause a short circuit or electrical issues. So, keep them checked and sealed properly before the monsoon.

 
What to do:
 

1. Book a pre-monsoon check-up with MyRaasta that covers wipers, tyres, wiring, brakes, and lights.


2. Replace faulty parts early to avoid emergencies on waterlogged roads.


3. Choose affordable car repairs like sealing wires or changing blades that save money and stress.


 

10. Why Is Fuel Mileage Going Down?
 

A sudden drop in your car’s fuel efficiency is a clear warning that something is off. Poor mileage leads to more fuel expenses and could also indicate common car engine problems or poor car maintenance.

 

What causes fuel mileage to drop? Dirty air filter
A clogged filter stops enough air from mixing with fuel, reducing engine performance and increasing fuel use.

 

1. Under-inflated tyres
If tyres don’t have enough pressure, they drag more on the road, using up more fuel.


2. Old or worn-out spark plugs
These cause poor combustion inside the engine and make it consume extra petrol or diesel.


3. Delayed oil changes
Old engine oil creates friction inside the engine, lowering mileage and heating up the engine.

 

How to improve it:

 

1. Get your air filters cleaned, serviced or replaced every 5,000–10,000 km, depending on your car’s driving conditions.


2. Keep your tyre pressure maintained in all the tyres while checking them every 2–3 weeks.


3. Change Car Engine Oil every 6–12 months, even if the car is driven less.
